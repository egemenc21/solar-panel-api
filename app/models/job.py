    # Real-Life Example
# Imagine you have a task management app where users can create tasks for themselves or others. Here's how it works:

# User: John creates a task to fix a broken solar panel.
# Job: The task (or job) has a description ("Fix the broken solar panel"), a location ("123 Solar St."), a status (1 for 'pending'), and an optional image link (a photo of the broken panel).
# Owner: John is the owner of this task, so his user ID is linked to the job.
